# I used twilio as a SMS API and openweather for getting the weather conditions. 
## here are the two websites :

- #### Twilio : https://www.twilio.com/
- #### Openweather : https://openweathermap.org/

## To run the application : 

> * export OWM_API_KEY=YOUR OPENWHEATHER KEY HERE
> * export AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR AUTH TOKEN FROM TWILIO HERE
> * python3 app.py
